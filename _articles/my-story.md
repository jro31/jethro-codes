## The pre-coding years

Throughout my teenage years, I'd been very into video games, so it seemed logical that when it came to choosing my subjects for sixth-form college, that computing was one of them.

On the first day of this A-level computing course, aged 16, I sat in the classroom, listening to the teacher drone on in his monotone voice about topics that I didn't understand. I looked around the class, and saw myself surrounded by peers that I couldn't relate to.

I felt very out of place.

I had some friends who'd taken ecomonmics and business studies, and they were raving about how fun the content had been of their first class, and how charismatic their teacher was. They had genuinely enjoyed it.

Having felt like an imposter, I quickly changed courses, and dropped computing in favour of studying economics and business. And you know what?

My friends were right.

I wasn't even in their class. I had different peers and a different teacher. But the way the course was taught was fun and exciting. It felt like real world knowledge that could be valuable.

The way I saw the world at this point, was that I'd been in education for about as long as I had memories.

The furthest I'd ventured from my hometown of London, was that I'd gone on a school trip to Berlin, although like with all school trips, it wasn't like I had the freedom to roam the city alone.

Having never travelled further than that, on finishing sixth-form college at 17, the world seemed a very big place to me, ripe for exploring.

There had to be more to life than just sitting in classrooms. And so rather than going straight off to university like everyone I knew, I decided to take a gap year.

My plan was simple. I was going to work for the first 6 months of this gap year and save every penny that I could. Then with the money that I'd saved, I was going to go overseas for the next six months afterwards, and travel to... wherever.

So I trained to be a lifeguard, and I got a job at my local swimming pool. And you know the great thing about being a lifeguard?

You just sit there all day and look at water.

Although it might not be the most engaging work you can do, it isn't stressful, and it isn't physcially challenging.

Of the jobs I'd had in my life up to this point, the first was that I'd delivered newspapers for a couple of years from 13. That work's not bad for a 13 year old, but it's not that easy either. Dragging around a cart with hundreds of papers in it will wear you out.

Then I'd worked in a restaurant kitchen for a few months, before moving to a pub and working front-of-house. All of these jobs were either stressful or demanding in some way, so the amount you could do them was finite.

Working as a lifeguard, I got to just sit there and look at water, lost in my own thoughts. And with a job like that, you can do it pretty indefinitely without getting stressed or tired.

Sure, there are moments when you start thinking to yourself that you'd rather be anywhere else, but I think that's going to be the case with anything you do too much.

What this meant though, was that I took every hour of overtime that became available. I would work 90+ hours some weeks, staring at water.

The pool would open at 6am, I was there. It would close at 10:30pm, I was there. Then I'd be back again at 6am the next morning to do it all again.

I was on little more than minimum wage. But even on minimum wage, if you work enough, you can make a decent amount of money. Especially for an 18 year old.

I'd never had much money before, and now suddenly I was looking at my bank balance each month being all... ka-ching!

When you suddenly find yourself living a very lucrative lifestyle, it's hard to turn your back on it to go travelling.

So I ended up working my entire gap year, and arrived at university with a bank balance that would have made most of my peers envious.

Back in my formative years, I'd always fared well at school. I consistently got A grades, and had I kept on that path, really could have gone onto the best universities if I'd wanted to.

Unfortunately I hit a bit of a rebellious patch in my teens, and at that moment, education didn't seem all that important.

In fact, for those few years, I was more or less determined to do the opposite of anything I'd ever been told to do.

No more homework, that just gets in the way of playing video games. No more exercise. No more healthy food.

I arrived in my teenage years a fit and healthy straight-A student. By 18 I was overweight and unfit, and it was only thanks to the knowledge I'd procured prior to my teens, that I was able to get the grades to go to university at all. Oxford and Cambridge weren't going to be in my future though.

The advantage that I had over most other university applicants, was that by taking a gap year, I already knew my grades.

At that time you could apply to six universities. And the way I looked at it, was that having my grades already, if I applied for any university of which I had the required grades, I was going to get in. So why not apply for three universities of which I know I'll get in, and then I can apply for three long-shot universities that I don't quite have the grades for, because... well you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

I still favoured business over any other subject, so I was looking for a university with a good business school.

I'd now had a taste of what it was like to have money, and I liked it. And seeing as I was good at and enjoyed studying business, taking it at university just made sense.

More important in my decision process, was I only considered courses that offered a year on exchange.

I might have foregone the intended six months of travel during my gap year, but it wasn't like travel had ever left my mind, and if I could do it as part of my studies then... well why not?

Two of my three long-shot universities rejected me.

Liverpool University said no. Oxford Brookes University said no. So I went to the third one.

Glamorous, alluring and seductive. All words you're not going to associate with going to university in Hull; at that time considered the UK's worst city, as many people insisted on telling me.

But I'll tell you something, it isn't half a good place to go to university.

My rent was a third less than that of people I knew studying in nearby York and Leeds, and there wasn't a night in Hull where you couldn't find a bar doing £1 drinks.

I know that every university has a party atmosphere, but in Hull it was a bit different.

You have to have a slightly sadomasochistic personality to ever go to Hull anyway. And when you mesh those personalities with the cheaper drinks and the cheaper living costs, it made for a very fun time.

I visitied friends at other universities. It was never quite the same as in Hull.

I'd got over my teenage rebellious phase during my gap year, and conscious of how out of shape I'd become, had slimmed down to, judging by photos from then, concerningly thin levels.

Through a combination of running and starvation, I shed almost half my bodyweight in just a few weeks.

Looking back, that might not have been the healthiest way to do it, but it worked.

Fitness, and running in particular was suddenly very important to me.

I'd gone to university with a very open mind. This was my first time living away from home, and I was determined to try new things.

It seemed an obvious choice therefore, that I'd join the university running club, but when I met with them... well they're very uninspiring people.

Instead I joined the American football club.

Had I ever seen a game of American football before?

No.

Did I know what it was, or how to play?

No.

Was I, now weighing less than 60kgs, the right size and physique to play American football?

No.

It was one of those decisions, where looking back, I don't know what went through my mind to make me think it was a good idea. But I stuck with it through the duration of my studies, and loved every second.

No aspect of university life influenced me more than being on that team. And I was committed to it.

12 months earlier I'd been horrendously out of shape. Now I was worryingly skinny. All of a sudden I found myself with the motivation to bulk-up, which really introduced a gym lifestyle to me.

For my entire university life, I lived in the gym. I was there almost everyday.

I ate well, but I ate a lot in order to try to gain weight. But as well as the gym, I kept up with running, and I had American football practice twice a week. And burning all those calories, eating sufficiently to gain weight wasn't even that easy.

Try telling that to the guy who, 12 months earlier, was fat and getting tired walking up a flight of stairs.

Fitness now took precedence over everything in my life, even my studies.

Although I hadn't travelled during my gap year, I had promised myself during the summer break after my first year at uni, I'd travel then instead.

That was four months to go abroad, and what I'd done was get a Canadian working visa. And no sooner had the final exams for the first year ended, I was on a flight to Vancouver; my first time leaving western Europe.

This was my first time, going somewhere new and unfamiliar, and having to build a life for myself there, even if it was just for the short-term.

I had my first night in a hostel booked, but after that I was on my own.

I quickly found myself a flat-share, and I got a part-time job bussing tables in a bar, and another one working for a waiting agency.

Neither the most glamorous job in the world, but they paid the bills.

One night, the waiting agency send me to an event at the Vancouver Aquarium. A wedding. It was a great place for a wedding actually. The dinner took place underneath one of the tanks, so you ate dinner with all these animals swimming over your head.

The best part for me though, was that after the party had finished and everything was cleared away, I got to wander around this aquarium in the middle of the night, watching all the animals sleeping.

That was where I discovered that otters sleep holding hands.

Vancouver was an amazing city to go to. This was my first time ever travelling, or even going on holiday on my own. And it was a great place for it all to begin.

It's a city with the sea on one side, and mountains on the other. Nowhere in the city do you not get stunning views. And to this day, I feel a great level of affection towards it.

But one thing I'd done, was that when I'd booked my flights, I'd flown out of London to Vancouver. However, my flight back to London four months later, that left from New York. And well, if you look at a map, Vancouver and New York aren't exactly next to each other. I'd set it up so that I had to do some travelling before I got home again, so after about 10 weeks, I packed-up and I left Vancouver.

This part, you could perhaps say, was my introduction to backpacking.

I initially headed over to Vancouver Island, before spending two days on ferries going up through some stunning coastline until I found myself in Alaska.

I might have matured slightly from the rebellious teenager playing video games, but I was still only 19, and I hadn't exactly learned to be mindful of my safety, wandering up mountains in shorts and a t-shirt, no map, no clue where I was going.

As I learned the hard way, snow melts from the bottom as much as it does from the top, so if you happen to fall through it, it's not like the ground's right underneath. And now was late summer, so when I did find myself on snow, up a mountain by myself in a t-shirt and shorts, I was lucky I wasn't injured when it gave way beneath me.

But you learn by making mistakes, and so long as those mistakes don't kill you, you know better for next time.

Of these six weeks before I got to New York, about one full week was spent in transit.

24 hours on a bus one day. 28 hours a couple of days later. It was 52 hours sitting on a bus before I'd made my way east, but my logic had been that you don't see anything while sitting on a plane, and so I'd gone from Alaska to New York by bus, stopping for a couple of days in various towns and cities as I went.

And you know what?

52 hours sitting on a bus might not sound everyone's cup of tea, but I'd loved every second of it.

This trip had introduced me to travelling, and it was fair to say that I'd caught the bug.

Luckily I had a year abroad to look forward to as the third year of my degree. And although my first choice had been to go to Copenhagen Business School, I was given my second choice: Dalhousie University, back in Canada again, although this time on the east coast.

It was a new university to me, in another country. And all the international students went through inductions together, so we all got to know each other. People from the US, Austalia and New Zealand, Mexico, Korea, all over Europe...

They were some fun parties too.

Having never spent more than a few days overseas a couple of years before this, I'd now spent more than a year away in these two trips.

And having arrived at university with a love of money and a desire to be rich, that no longer seemed so important to me.

The world's too big and life too short to spend it sitting in an office, just to make money.

For the value of having a degree, I finished my final year of university. But in truth, I knew by now that I was never going to make use of this business degree.

If I'd followed the typical career path of a business graduate, I'd have found myself some low-level management job in some office on graduating, and spent the next forty years of my life saving a pension and paying-off a mortgage and having 2.4 children and... I just couldn't face it.

Nothing in life scares me more than regret. Even back then, I always imagined that one day, I was going to find myself, lying on my death bed, looking back over my life, too late to change anything or do anything new. And in that moment, I didn't want to find myself looking back with regret.

And if I'd followed the path laid-out for me here; the path of a business graduate, to spend his life working in an office, there's no way I wouldn't look back with regret.

My first time abroad had given me the travel bug. This year on exchange had done nothing to deter me. And so by now, I knew that I was going to graduate, and I was going to leave.

I needed to live my life.

Being just an ocean away, and being able to get one more working visa there, I started this post-graduation trip back in Canada.

Before leaving, I got a job as a lifty at a ski resort.

To get that job, you had to be able to ski. I couldn't ski. So I did what anyone would do in that situation.

I lied. I figured I'd be able to pick it up quickly enough.

The alternative was working some job in the resort; cleaning rooms or serving people in a restaurant.

I wasn't working at a mountain to spend all day at the bottom of it.

![Working as a lifty](/images/my-story/pano.jpeg)
_Working as a lifty, February 2009_

It made the first couple of weeks of this job a bit awkward as I tried my best to pretend that I could ski, when actually I was terrified of anything but the flattest runs. But after a couple of weeks, I got really comfortable on my skis, and a couple of weeks after that, I was flying down this mountain. Until I wasn't.

While skiing too fast, I overshot a turn. I leaned-into it to try and compensate, and my skis went out from under me, and I started tumbling.

My right ski detached itself from my boot, my left ski didn't. I was tumbling, but with my ski still attached, my leg couldn't follow me.

In all the commotion, to this day I can vividly recall the feeling that my left femur was about to snap in half. Bearing that in mind, I consider myself lucky that I survived this fall with nothing more than cartilage damage. However, apart from some fairly flat runs at the start of spring, it put an end to my ski season, and it's an injury I still deal with to this day.

That sucks, but as with anything, you can't go back in time an change what happened, all you can do is learn from it. And this was perhaps the moment, now 23, that I learned that I wasn't invincible.

I'd played American football weighing less than 60kgs, and didn't care if I got hurt. I'd climbed mountains in Alaska without even a map. I just had absolute faith in myself to not die. All of a sudden though, I showed myself to be human. And while having pain in my knee to this day is an inconvenience, I always take it as a reminder that... hey, you've only got one body. Treat it well.

This ski season had lasted for about 5 months, but I was in Canada on a 12 month visa, and my plan was to head back to Vancouver, a city that I held, and still hold an incredible fondness of, and to find some work there. What ended up happening though, was I learned about WWOOFing. WWOOF, standing for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms.

The 'farms' in there is a bit deceptive, because it's open to anyone with an outdoors area that wants some free labour.

But the agreement is that you go to a "farm", and in exchange for food and board, you work for around 5 hours per day, 5 days per week.

That might sound like slave labour on the surface, but for someone in my situation, it was great.

Like I said, it wasn't limited to farms, and my first WWOOFing spot I worked on an independent resort on this barely populated island in the Gulf Islands between Vancouver Island and mainland Canada.

I'd been planning on going there for a week or two. I ended up staying for eight. When the resort wasn't full, I got to stay in the private cabins. These cost in excess of $300 to rent for a night. When there were events, such as weddings, there was an on site professional chef who would cook me dinner, otherwise I got free-reign to use this industrial kitchen. And the island itself was beautiful. You could run for miles and not see another person, and the beaches were glorious.

All that in exchange for 5 hours of gardening per day? Yes please.

It might not have felt like it as I ate my professionally-cooked meals, while sleeping in my $300 rooms, but I was very much in backpacker mode by now.

I was fully aware that the sooner the money in my bank account dried-up, the sooner I'd have to stop and settle down somewhere again. Every penny that I could save, I saved.

I continued WWOOFing in several more spots. And as I travelled around, I did so by thumb.

I'd bought myself a tent that I carried around in my backpack. That was my safety net, because when you're hitchhiking, you never quite know how far you can make it in a day or where you're going to get dropped off.

I spent many nights camped at the side of the road.

![Home for the night](/images/my-story/tent.jpeg)
_Home for the night, August 2009_

But that, for my remaining months in Canada, became my life.

I remember well the first time I hitchhiked. I'd met some hippies at my first WWOOFing gig who'd told me how easy it was, and I do remember that first time, standing at the side of the road with my thumb in the air, thinking _"I look like such an idiot."_

But after not too long, this girl picked me up. She drove me for a while until we parted ways, and I started again. And it always astounded me how willing people were to let a stranger into their car, but I could get further in a day hitchhiking than I could by bus.

Often people wanted the company. Truckers especially, I think wanted someone to talk to. At one point I was picked up by this Romanian couple who worked in Vancouver. They'd decided to go on a road trip together, but it wasn't going very well, so they picked me up so they didn't have to talk to each other.

I stayed with them for three days on my way to Dawson City in the north of the country.

There was a road in Northern Canada famed for hitchhikers getting murdered. I didn't know that until I was already halfway along it, but I never met anyone who struck me as a serial killer. It was generally a lot of fun, and for the people you met, much better than taking the bus.

I made it up to Dawson City, and then back down again. I made it all the over to the east of the country, finding myself in little towns that didn't even have buses running to them on the way.

If you don't mind the whole murdering hitchhikers thing, it's a great way to travel.

But alas, all good things must come to an end, and my 12 month visa in Canada was nearning its expiration.

Now this was not the end. It was not even the beginning of the end. But it was, perhaps, the end of the beginning.

When I'd left England 12 months earlier, I'd said to myself and to others, that this was going to be a 10 year trip. Canada was to be my first, but certainly not my last stop.

The wonderful thing about Canada, or one of the wonderful things about Canada, is how sparsely populated it is.

I'm sure that it's changed now, but I remember a stat for The Yukon in Northern Canada at that time, where it had a population of 34,000 people. However, 26,000 of them were in Whitehorse, the provincial capital.

A total of 8,000 people populated the rest of this province, that is two-and-a-half times the size of the UK.

You can understand a bit more from that, why hitch-hiking around there is so easy.

You might only see one car every few minutes, but the frequency with which they pick you up is so great, because who wants to drive for hundreds of miles alone?

I remember seeing a sign warning that the next gas station was 1,000 miles away.

I was about to head south into the US, where my feeling was that things were going to be a bit different.

Not only is the US a lot more populated than its northern neighbour, but hitchiking isn't even legal in all states.

Almost everyone in the US has a car. And for the few who don't, if you want to travel, you take the Greyhound bus. And at this time, Greyhound offered a 'Freedom Pass', where for $500, you could take unlimited buses for two months.

My thinking was that if I slept on enough buses, that pass would pay for itself in money I saved on accommodation.

And so that was how my time in the US was. I didn't sleep on Greyhound buses every night, that would be enough to drive anyone crazy. But anytime I was travelling somewhere, I made sure to do so at night-time. And if I was in a town and couldn't find somewhere to stay within my very restrictive budget, I'd go to the bus station in the evening and take a bus anywhere 10-12 hours away.

Much like hitchhiking in Canada, I met some very interesting people on those buses.

I learned that in the US, when someone gets released from prison, they give them a Greyhound bus ticket to get home again. There was one point where five of us were standing around chatting at a rest-stop, and I was the only one there that didn't have prison stories to share.

Also like hitchhiking in Canada, this way of travelling took me to some great places that I probably would have avoided otherwise.

Charleston in South Carolina had a reputation as the murder capital of the US at this time. I didn't know that when in Washington DC, I couldn't find a bed for less than $20, so off the to the bus station I went, and up on the board there was a bus to Charleston that was about to leave and would take long enough to give me a night's sleep.

It was one of my favourite places in the country.

In fact, there seems to be a correlation between how likely you are to get murdered somewhere, and how nice of a place it is to visit.

In these two months, I'd found my way to all four corners of the country, and many places in between. But the expiration of my Freedom Pass also marked the end of my time in the US. And what I'd done, was go onto Spirit Airlines' website, and look for the cheapest flight I could get out of the country from Miami, where I was right now.

"Bogota."

Well alright, I guess Bogota it is.

In 2022, Colombia's considered a great holiday destination. In 2009 this wasn't the case, and it still had a repuation as being the home of drug cartels.

My lack of awareness for personal safety hadn't paid much attention to this, and it was only when I started mentioning to people I met in Miami that I was about to fly to Bogota that they would stare at me for a moment, motionless, before saying something like _"be careful down there."_

I'd heard so much hearsay about how dangerous Colombia was, that by the time I boarded the plane I was convinced I wouldn't last the first night.

But it proved true again, that the higher the chance of getting murdered, the better a place is to visit. I loved Colombia.

I got there at exactly the right time. It was a beautiful, safe, friendly country. Perhaps the happiest place I've ever been. But no one else knew about it.

Like I said, the reputation that Colombia had within the US was that it was the land of drug cartels.

And I won't misrepresent things and tell you that I was the only tourist. There was a very established backpacking route through South America, and that included Colombia. To people who were already here, it was no secret how amazing Colombia was to visit. But its reputation in the outside world stopped it becoming infested with tourists.

I stayed there for six weeks, even learning to dive. And when it came time to leave, I did so in a very Douglas MacArthuresque fashion, promising that _'I will return.'_

Six weeks wasn't enough. It was the greatest place I'd ever been.

![Diving in Taganga](/images/my-story/diving-in-colombia.jpeg)
_Diving in Taganga, January 2010_

I spent the better part of a year in South America, meandering my way south through the continent.

As well as Colombia, there's no doubt that the other highlight was Bolivia. I stayed there for everyday of the 90 that they permitted me on entry, even stopping to spend a month learning Spanish.

I couldn't pick just one, but if you asked me to name the happiest moment in my life, it would probably something from these few months.

![Quito](/images/my-story/quito.jpeg)
_Quito, Ecuador, January 2010_

And on getting as far south as Argentina, my plan was to head back north again, keeping my promise to return to Colombia.

After this long backpacking though, money was a little tight, and on arriving in Buenos Aires I secured my next income, again working as a lifty, although this time in the US.

I figured that by the time I'd made it back to Colombia, winter would just be starting, so it would all align perfectly.

![La Paz](/images/my-story/la-paz.jpeg)
_La Paz, Bolivia, April 2010_

Unfortunately, a short time later as I arrived in Paraguay, I was greeted by the news of a family bereavement that would mean my first visit to the UK on this trip.

My knee was still causing me a lot of discomfort, and back in a land of free healthcare, I took the opportunity to get it properly looked at.

When the injury had first happened back in Canada, I'd got nothing but an x-ray, because I didn't want to have to pay for anything more. The doctor had told me that there was likely some ligament damage, but I'd never had any confirmation of this.

Except it hurt.

![Samaipata](/images/my-story/samaipata.jpeg)
_Samaipata, Bolivia, May 2010_

You can become numb to anything if you experience it enough, and I'd had two continents to get used to the pain. But seeing as I was back on UK soil, I stayed long enough to get an MRI and get my knee diagnosed.

And thankfully there was no ligament damage, just cartilage.

I was told I'd need surgery at some point, but it wasn't urgent. So I did what anyone smart would do in that situation:

I went and worked another ski season.

The time this had taken made flying back to South America and continuing my trip north illogical. So instead, my girlfriend at that time, who'd I'd met backpacking in South America but who was going east anyway, came over and we spent some time travelling in Europe before I flew off to the US.

I'd had a great time travelling in the US a year or so earlier. Sadly, my experience of working there didn't match this, and I found American workplace politics uncompromising so as to drive you to despair.

For example, I worked on a ski resort. It wasn't as cold as it had been in Canada, where temperatures at the top of the mountain reached as low as -40°c. Here it was far more mild, rarely getting below -15°c. But it was still cold enough that when you were out on the mountain, you'd be covered from head to toe.

It didn't stop them having a rule where you had to shave everyday before work, and they'd check.

Despite the fact that the person enforcing this rule had a beard, the logic was that it looked more professional if the lifties were clean shaven.

Even on the warmer spring days, where my face was uncovered, I've never heard someone go skiing and say _"well, the snow was great, and skiing was great, and the weather was great. However, I had a really bad day because one of the lifties had a bit of stubble on his chin."_

It was ridiculous.

I thought maybe it was just a bad job, so before the season's end, I got a summer job on the east coast, working as a bellman in a fancy hotel on Nantucket island, which might not sound too glamorous.

In fact, it wasn't too glamorous, I carried people's bags for a living. However, staff accommodation was included, so I had no rent and no bills.

On top of that, I made $11 an hour. But the tips. Oh, the tips. It was the kind of place where people would call us up, asking if they could land their helicopter on the hotel lawn. At one point, someone gave me $50 for carrying their quite small bag, from reception all of about 10 metres to their room.

The politics here, too, drove me insane. However, I stuck with it for as long as I could, just for the money I was making.

I eventually gave-in about four months into the season, and tendered my resignation. But by that point, I'd saved enough to cover everything that I'd spent in South America and then some.

As I was in the US on a working visa, the moment I resigned, I legally had 10 days to leave the country. And where was I going?

Where else? I've got unfinished business in South America.

I had some airline credit saved from an ealier incident where I'd been asked me to change flights at the last minute, and I'd been compensated with $500 in credit for the inconvenience. Despite the direct flight they were moving me onto leaving later and arriving earlier than the route with transfer that I was initially supposed to take.

I'll take that deal all day.

So I used some of this credit to pay for a flight down to Fort Lauderdale, where I knew from experience there were cheap flights to Colombia.

At some point down in the Florida sun though, I had an epiphony.

_"What is the point in travelling if you're just going to go to the places that you've already been?"_

By now I had about 2 days to leave the country, so on a moment's notice and with zero planning or research, I used the remainder of this credit to fly to Los Angeles, and the next day I was on a flight to Bangkok.

I didn't initially take to Thailand if I'm honest.

My knowledge of Thailand stretched about as far as I'd seen 'The Beach' once, but I didn't really know more than that. But my initial impression, was that it was incredibly touristy, and incredibly tame.

South America had struck the perfect chord with me.

It was just touristy enough, where you would always be able to find a backpackers hostel with people who were going out, but not so touristy that you couldn't get away from it at times either.

And it had a bit of edge. I was lucky, but most people had a story about being robbed, or their bus being held-up at gunpoint somewhere, usually in Peru, or something along those lines.

No one had those stories in Thailand, it was incredibly safe.

I remember at the time thinking that it would be an amazing place to retire to, but that wasn't really what I was looking for.

Compared to South America where every country gave me a 90-day visa on arrival, in south-east Asia, the custom is for 30 days.

And when you're like me, and don't really like doing things quickly, 30 days feels like a rush.

I made my way slowly north through the country, but it wasn't long before my visa was expiring, so I did what everyone else does, and crossed-over to Laos, just to come back in again for another 30 days.

Ah, bureaucracy.

I'm going to be honest, when I'd got off the plane in Bangkok a month earlier, I'd never even heard of Laos, but here I was.

I was staying at a hostel in Vientiane, and they had a little rooftop balcony. I was sitting up there, when I happened to glance at the notice board.

_"Do you want a visa for China?"_ it said.

I... actually that sounds quite fun.

And that's how it happened.

Rather than heading straight back to Thailand, I got a visa for China, and made my way north through Laos, spending many, many hours on dirty roads in uncomfortable vans and minibuses.

Laos is a country about the same size as Thailand, but with 10% of the population, so in that regard, it's similar to Canada and the US. And where as in Thailand, I'd grown frustated with all the tourism, here it was much easier to escape.

At one point I was in the village of Muang Ngoi, which took an hour in a longboat just to get to.

I got handed a map no bigger than my hand, by some people who told me that there was a Hmong village called Ban Kloukhan a few hours hike away.

What the Hell is a Hmong village? Only one way to find out, and having a map is being pretty prepared for me, so off I wandered into the jungle.

Turns-out there's a lot of leeches in the jungle, and they can smell you coming.

No matter how diligent you were in swiping them away, you would constantly find them climbing up, and sometimes falling into your shoes. But you couldn't stop and take your shoes off, because there were so many of them, coming at you from all angles.

It was like a zombie apocalpse, with really, really small worm-like zombies.

I've never known fear like the moment I fell in that jungle.

When I eventually arrived in this village, not long before sundown, I had blood-drenched socks from all the leech-bites, and when I tried to talk to the villagers, the first ones looked at me like I was crazy.

_Turns out wearing white socks wasn't the best choice_

_"Well... this is going to be a fun night,"_ I thought to myself.

Thankfully I was eventually able to find a villager who let me stay in his house.

I'd arrived in this village on the day of a wedding, or the day before a wedding. I never really found out. It wasn't too easy to communicate.

But they did let me... or rather, made me join in the celebration, which was basically everyone sitting around in a circle taking shots of homemade rice whiskey.

It was cool though. I enjoyed my night at this village.

_Ban Kloukhan, October 2011_

After initially only coming here as a means to get another Thai visa, I'd really taken to Laos, so it was again frustrating that I was only permitted to stay for 30 days. But I had my China visa, so I continued onto the town of Luang Namtha in the north of the country, where I could take a bus across the border.
