## The pre-coding years

Throughout my teenage years, I'd been very into video games, so it seemed logical that when it came to choosing my subjects for sixth-form college, that computing was one of them.

But in the first day of this A-level computing course, aged 16, I sat the classroom, listening to the teacher drone in his monotone voice about topics that I didn't understand.

I looked around the class, and saw myself surrounded by a group of peers that I couldn't relate to.

I had some friends who'd taken ecomonmics and business studies, and they were raving about how fun and charismatic the teacher had been in their first class. They had genuinely enjoyed it.

Having felt like an imposter, I quickly changed my courses, and dropped computing, in favour of studying economics and business. And you know what?

My friends were right.

I wasn't even in their class. I had different peers, and a different teacher. But the way the course was taught was fun and exciting. It felt like real world knowledge that could be valuable to me.

The way I saw the world at this point, was that I'd been in education for about as long as I had memories.

To this point in my life, the furthest I'd ventured from my hometown of London, was that I'd gone on a school trip to Berlin, although like with all school trips, it's not like you get the freedom to roam the city alone. Rather you're shuttled along like pensioners in a Post Office. I'd had a couple of day-trips to France as well, but that was as far as I'd got.

And on finishing sixth-form college at 17, the world seemed a very big place, ripe for exploring.

There had to be more to life than just sitting in classrooms. And so rather than going straight off to university like all of my friends, I decided to take a gap year.

My plan was simple. I was going to work for the first 6 months of this gap year and save every penny that I could. Then with the money that I'd saved, I was going to go overseas for the next six months afterward, and to travel... wherever.

So I trained to be a lifeguard, and I got a job at my local swimming pool. And you know the great thing about being a lifeguard?

You just have to sit there and look at water all day.

Although it might not be the most engaging work you can do, it isn't stressful, and it isn't physcially challenging.

Of the jobs I'd had in my life up to this point, the first was that I'd delivered newspapers for a couple of years from 13. That work's not bad for a 13 year old, but it's not that easy either, dragging around a cart with hundreds of papers in it will wear you out.

Then I'd worked in a restaurant kitchen for a few months, before moving to a pub and working front-of-house. All of these jobs were either stressful or demanding in some way, so the amount you could do them was really limited.

Working as a lifeguard though, I got to just sit there and look at water, lost in my own thoughts. And with a job like that, you can do it pretty indefinitely without getting stressed or tired.

Sure, there are moments when you start thinking to yourself that you'd rather be anywhere else, but I think that's going to be the case with anything.

What this meant though, was that I took every hour of overtime that became available. I would work 90+ hours some weeks, staring at water.

The pool would open at 6am, I was there. It would close at 10:30pm. I was there. Then I'd be back again at 6am the next morning to do it all again.

I was on little more than minimum wage. But even on minimum wage, if you work enough, you can make a decent amount of money.

Especially for an 18 year old.

I'd never had much money before, and now suddenly I was looking at my bank balance each month being all... ka-ching!

When you suddenly find yourself living a very lucrative lifestyle, it's very hard to turn your back on it to go travelling instead.

So I ended up working for the entirety of my gap year, and arrived at university with a bank balance that would have made most of my peers envious.

Back in my formative years, I'd always fared well at school. I consistently got A grades, and had I kept on that path, really could have gone onto the best universities if I wanted.

Unfortunately I hit a somewhat rebellious stage once I reached my teens, and at that point, education didn't seem all that important.

In fact, for those few years, I was more or less determined to do the opposite of anything I'd ever been told to do.

No more homework, that just gets in the way of time playing video games. No more exercise. No more healthy food.

I arrived in my teenage years a fit and healthy straight A student. By 18 I was overweight and unfit, and it was only thanks to the knowledge I'd procured prior to my teens, that I was able to get the grades to go to university at all. Oxford and Cambridge weren't going to be in my future though.

The advantage that I had over most other university applicants, was that by taking a gap year, I already knew my grades.

At that time you could apply to six universities. And the way I looked at it, was that having my grades already, if I applied for any university of which I had the required grades, I was going to get in. So why not apply for three universities of which I know I'll get in, and then I can apply for three long-shot universities because... well you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

At this time, I still favoured business over any other subject, so I was looking for a university with a good business school.

I'd now had a taste of what it was like to have money, and I liked it. And seeing as I was good at and enjoyed studying it, business studies just made sense to me.

More importantly than that though, I only considered courses that offered a year on exchange.

I might have foregone the intended six months of travel during my gap year. But it wasn't like travel had ever left my mind, and if I could do it as part of my studies then... well why not?

Two of my three long-shot universities rejected me.

Liverpool University said no. Oxford Brookes University said no. So I went with the third one.

Glamorous, alluring and seductive. All words you're unlikely to associate with going to university in Hull; at that time considered the UK's worst city, as many people insisted on telling me.

But I'll tell you something; it isn't half a good place to go to university.

My rent was a third that of people I knew studying in nearby York and Leeds, and there wasn't a night in Hull where you couldn't find a bar doing Â£1 drinks.

I know that every university has a party atmosphere. But in Hull it was a bit different.

You had to have a sligtly sadomasochistic personality to go to Hull in the first place. And with the cheaper drinks and the cheaper living costs, it made for a very fun time.

I visitied friends at other universities. It was never quite the same as in Hull.

I'd got over my teenage rebellious phase during my gap year, and now conscious of how out of shape I'd become, had slimmed down to, judging by photos from this time, dangerously thin levels.

Through a combination of starvation and running, I shed almost half my bodyweight in just a few weeks.

Looking back, that might not have been the smartest way to do it. But worked.

Fitness, and running in particular was suddenly very important to me.

I'd gone to university with a very open mind. This was my first time living away from home, and I was determined to try new things.

It seemed an obvious choice that I'd join the university running club, but when I met with them... God, this sounds the most boring club in the world.

Instead I joined the American football club.

Had I ever seen a game of American football before?

No.

Did I know what it was, or even how to play?

No.

Was I, now weighing less than 60kgs, the right size and physique to play American football?

No.
