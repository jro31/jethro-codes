I wasnâ€™t going to write an article about this app, because I thought itâ€™d be a bit weird to write about an app within the app. Some kind of appception.

I imagine thatâ€™s what the people who make Git go through everyday.

However, in creating this app, I learned a lot that I didn't know before, so I think itâ€™s worth going over and maybe it can help someone.

Being an app consisting mostly of articles, it made sense to me that Iâ€™d write them in Markdown. And what I wanted, was to be able to add a Markdown file, and by simply adding this file and doing nothing else, I wanted the homepage to update, the section page (for example, the 'Projects' page or the 'Templates' page) to update, and even the sitemap to update.

I had a rough idea how I could achieve this, but then I found that [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) has a template project that was better than my idea, and using that as my starting point, I was able to build the foundations of this app so it does exactly what I wanted.

I added this article as a Markdown file, and by doing nothing else, as if by magic it appears on the homepage, the projects page, and in the sitemap.

## Background

My reasoning for creating this app was fairly simple.

At this point, [jethrowilliams.com](https://jethrowilliams.com/) was already online, and that was my sort ofâ€¦ front page, if you will.

If I want to give someone a very quick overview of exactly what it is I do, and how they can contact me, then I can direct them to jethrowilliams.com. And for the majority of people, thatâ€™s going to be enough.

However, this front-page doesnâ€™t allow me to go into any depth on the code I create because most people, especially non-technical people, just wonâ€™t care.

So I wanted a place, partly for my own benefit because I find it insightful to have to explain something in a manner that others can understand, where I can go into more depth on the code that I write.

As coincidence would have it, I already owned the domain jethro.codes because, on putting my name into the Namecheap app in a moment of boredom once, I stumbled across it, it was available, and it had a 90% discount.

So I figured, for Â£3 Iâ€™ll buy it for a year. If I think of something to do with it, great. If not, it's cost me less than a cup of coffee.

And I donâ€™t drink coffee, so I had nothing to spend that money on anyway.

## Styling

Before I get onto the technical part of this app, a quick word about styling.

This app may look like it was cobbled together with a bunch of random components that donâ€™t have any relation to each other. And thatâ€™s because... well it was.

Up to this point, every app I'd ever made I'd done the styling myself. And although I enjoy and I'm very good at styling, it's such a time consuming process, tweaking every element for various devices and screen sizes.

I just wanted a place where I can write about code, and in all truth, so long as it doesn't look completely atrocious, I'm not too concerned with how it looks.

So while I have done some minor customisation, this app is largely made up of [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) components.

Again, with some minor customisation, the Markdown articles themselves are styled with the [Tailwind typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin).

The Tailwind docs are some of the best I've ever come across, and do a far better job of explaining how to use these features than I ever could, so I won't say anything more about the styling for jethro.codes in this article, because I spent very little time on it.

What I instead want to focus on is fetching the Markdown articles, and updating the app accordingly.

## Structure

Before getting into the API and fetching the articles, it's worth mentioning the stucture of the app to make everything a little clearer.

Note that this is (fairly obviously) a simplified version of the app. I'm only showing relevant folders here.

```
ðŸ“¦_articles
 â”£ ðŸ“‚projects
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œjethro-codes.md
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmeals-of-change.md
 â”£ ðŸ“‚templates
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œrails-api.md
 â”— ðŸ“œmy-story.md
ðŸ“¦lib
 â”£ ðŸ“œapi.js
 â”— ðŸ“œmarkdownToHtml.js
ðŸ“¦pages
 â”£ ðŸ“‚[section]
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ[slug].js
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.js
 â”£ ðŸ“‚contact
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.js
 â”£ ðŸ“‚my-story
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.js
 â”£ ðŸ“œ_app.js
 â”£ ðŸ“œindex.js
 â”— ðŸ“œsitemap.xml.js
```

To start with, the `_articles` folder, is where the articles are added as Markdown files.

The `pages` folder shows the pages within the app.

The `api.js` file in the `lib` folder is where all the magic happens. This is where the logic to look within the `_articles` folder and return the correct data to the pages lives.

If you're used to working on MVC apps, then the `api.js` file is very much the controller; the intermediary between the data (the `_articles`) and what the user sees (the `pages`).

If you understand how the API works, then the rest of the app is fairly rudimentary, so let's start by going over that.

## API

The API is based on [the API from the Vercel demo project](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/blog-starter/lib/api.js).

It exports three functions needed by the various pages used within the app:

- `getArticles`
- `getArticleBySlug`
- `allContainingFolders`

### `allContainingFolders`

I'll start with the simplest of these: `allContainingFolders`.

This function returns any folder within `_article`, that contains a markdown article.

```js
import fs from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';

const articlesPath = join(process.cwd(), '_articles');

export const allContainingFolders = () =>
  ['', ...fs.readdirSync(articlesPath)].filter(file => file.slice(-3) !== '.md');
```

`process.cwd()` returns the current working directory. The `join()` function, joins the arguments you give it, as a path. So by running `join(process.cwd(), '_articles')`, we pass it the current working directory, followed by `_articles`, to give us the path to our `_articles` folder.

This is set to the `articlesPath` variable.

`fs` (short for 'file system') is a Node library. The `readdirSync()` function (short for 'read directory synchronously') returns the contents of the directory that you pass it.

So `fs.readdirSync(articlesPath)` returns an array of all files and folders which are direct children to the `_articles` folder.

Looking back to the file tree above, that is `['my-story.md', 'projects', 'templates']`.

We are looking _just_ for folders here, not files, so `.filter(file => file.slice(-3) !== '.md')` removes any returns where the last three characters of the string are `.md` (so in this example, it will remove `'my-story.md'`).

However, because there _is_ a Markdown article within the `_articles` folder itself, we also want to return this, hence adding `''` to the returned array (the `my-story.md` article is a permanent fixture of this app, so no need to programatically check if a Markdown file exists as a child to the `_articles` directory).

Therefore, given the file tree above, `allContainingFolders()` will return `[ '', 'projects', 'templates' ]`.

### `getArticleBySlug`

The next exportable function in the API is `getArticleBySlug`. This returns one article, based on the slug passed-into it.

A 'slug' in this context is the part of the URL that comes after the last backslash. So on this page, the slug is `jethro-codes`. On the `https://jethro.codes/my-story` page, the slug is `my-story`.

As a side-note, I was curious why it's called a slug, because when I think of a slug, I think of a snail without a shell, which seems completely irrelevant here.

The best explanation I could find was [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4230937/2475306), which gives a couple of possibilities for the origin of 'slug' in this context.

It's either _"an informal name given to a story during the production process"_ of the printing press, or _"screenplays had "slug lines" at the start of each scene, which basically sets the background for that scene."_

Regardless of where it came from, `getArticleBySlug()` returns one article, based on the slug you pass it:

```js
import fs from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';

const articlesPath = join(process.cwd(), '_articles');
const directoryPath = containingFolder =>
  `${articlesPath}${containingFolder ? `/${containingFolder}` : ''}`;

export const getArticleBySlug = (slug, fields = [], containingFolder = '') => {
  const realSlug = slug.replace(/\.md$/, '');
  const fullPath = join(directoryPath(containingFolder), `${realSlug}.md`);
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);

  const items = {};

  fields.forEach(field => {
    if (field === 'slug') {
      items[field] = realSlug;
    }
    if (field === 'section') {
      items[field] = containingFolder;
    }
    if (field === 'content') {
      items[field] = content;
    }
    if (field === 'minsToRead') {
      items[field] = Math.ceil(content.split(' ').length / 200);
    }

    if (typeof data[field] !== 'undefined') {
      items[field] = data[field];
    }
  });

  return items;
};
```

This function accepts three arguments:

The `slug` of the article, the `fields` within the article that you want returned (we'll get into that in a moment), and the `containingFolder`.

To start with, `const realSlug = slug.replace(/\.md$/, '');` simply removes the `.md` extension, if one is passed-in on the slug, and sets the resulting string to `realSlug`.

For example, if I passed `my-story.md` in as the `slug` argument, this would set `my-story` to `realSlug`.

On the next line, we use the `join()` function again (covered in the previous section).

The `directoryPath()` function simply checks whether the a `containingFolder` is present. If it is, it will return a string of the `articlesPath` followed by the containing folder, if not it will just return the `articlesPath`.

So `` const fullPath = join(directoryPath(containingFolder), `${realSlug}.md`); `` sets the full path of the location of the article, to the `fullPath` variable.

Now that we have this path, we pass it to `fs.readFileSync`, which returns the contents of the file path we pass to it.

So, for example, if our `fullPath` variable is set to `jethro-codes/_articles/projects/meals-of-change.md`, then `const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');` sets the contents of the `meals-of-change.md` file to the `fileContents` variable, in utf8 format.

Lastly we pass this `fileContents` to [`gray-matter`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter).

What `gray-matter` does, is allow us to add YAML to the top of our Markdown files.

For example, at the top of this file that I'm typing right now, is the following:

```yaml
---
title: 'jethro.codes'
description: 'A look behind the mechanics of how this app utilises Markdown files to automatically update the homepage and other pages.'
coverImage: '/images/projects/jethro-codes/hero-screenshot.png'
published: '2022-04-25' # TODO - Update this
tags: 'Next JS, React, Tailwind CSS, Vercel'
---
```

When we `import matter from 'gray-matter';` and then call `matter(fileContents)`, it returns an object with two keys: `data` and `content`.

The value of `content` is the Markdown that comes _after_ this YAML code, so in this article:

> I wasnâ€™t going to write an article about this app, because I thought itâ€™d be a bit weird to write about an app within the app. Some kind of appception...

(and this is exactly what I meant)

It contains formatting, although for simplicity I won't add that here (we'll get to it later).

The value of `data`, is another object, that contains the "data" of this YAML code, for example:

```js
data: {
  title: 'jethro.codes',
  description: 'A look behind the mechanics of how this app utilises Markdown files to automatically update the homepage and other pages.',
  coverImage: '/images/projects/jethro-codes/hero-screenshot.png',
  published: '2022-04-25',
  tags: 'Next JS, React, Tailwind CSS, Vercel'
}
```

We then use object destructuring to set the data and content to `data` and `content` variables respectively:

```js
const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);
```

Now we have all that we need to know about the article.

What we eventually return is the `const items = {};` object, so now it's just a case of filtering only the data that we want to return, and appending this data to `items`.

This is where the `fields` argument of `getArticleBySlug` comes in. To save accidentally returning too much data, we must pass-in every field we want returned.

We then loop-over each of these fields, and assign them to `items` accordingly:

```js
fields.forEach(field => {
  if (field === 'slug') {
    items[field] = realSlug;
  }
  if (field === 'section') {
    items[field] = containingFolder;
  }
  if (field === 'content') {
    items[field] = content;
  }
  if (field === 'minsToRead') {
    items[field] = Math.ceil(content.split(' ').length / 200);
  }

  if (typeof data[field] !== 'undefined') {
    items[field] = data[field];
  }
});
```

In the client-side code, the `containingFolder` is called the `section`, for example the `projects` section or the `templates` section.

The `minsToRead` field splits the `content` based on spaces to (roughly) give the number of words in the article (`content.split(' ').length`).

This number is then divided by 200, on the assumption that a person reads around 200 words per minute.

That's the more conservative end of the spectrum of reading speed (per multiple sources), but people tend to read more slowly looking at screens, and I doubt many people will be bothering to print-off these articles to read them, so it makes sense to be at that end.

`if (typeof data[field] !== 'undefined')` simply checks that a field exists in `data` before trying to return it.

And with that, we've set all the data that we need, so return `items`.

## `getArticles`

The last exportable function is `getArticles`.

This uses a lot of the functionality that we've already been over, except that it uses it to return multiple articles.

In the name of simplicity, I'll only add the code that we haven't been over here:

```js
const getArticleSlugs = containingFolder => {
  return fs.readdirSync(directoryPath(containingFolder));
};

const allArticles = (fields = []) => {
  let articlesArray = [];
  allContainingFolders().map(folder => {
    getArticleSlugs(folder).map(slug => {
      if (slug.slice(-3) === '.md') {
        articlesArray.push(getArticleBySlug(slug, fields, folder));
      }
    });
  });
  return articlesArray;
};

const articlesByFolder = (fields = [], folder) =>
  getArticleSlugs(folder).map(slug => getArticleBySlug(slug, fields, folder));

export const getArticles = (fields = [], containingFolder = '') => {
  let articles = containingFolder
    ? articlesByFolder(fields, containingFolder)
    : allArticles(fields);

  return articles.sort((article1, article2) => (article1.published > article2.published ? -1 : 1));
};
```

`getArticles` accepts two arguments; `fields` and `containingFolder`.

`fields` is used as we've seen earlier, to set which fields from each article are returned.

If omitted, the `containingFolder` here determines that we return _all_ articles, as is necessary for the homepage or the sitemap, and calls the `allArticles()` function. If it is provided, then it will return _just_ the articles from within that folder by calling the `articlesByFolder()` function:

```js
containingFolder ? articlesByFolder(fields, containingFolder) : allArticles(fields);
```

Starting with `articlesByFolder()`, it firstly calls `getArticleSlugs()`.

```js
const getArticleSlugs = containingFolder => {
  return fs.readdirSync(directoryPath(containingFolder));
};
```

`getArticleSlugs()` uses the `fs.readdirSync()` function, which we went over earlier, and returns an array of all of the slugs contained _within_ the given folder. For example,

```js
getArticleSlugs('projects');
```

returns

```js
['jethro-codes.md', 'meals-of-change.md'];
```

Now that we know all of the articles that we want to return, it's simply a case of mapping over this array, calling `getArticleBySlug()` (gone over in the previous section) on each one, and returning the resulting array.

```js
const articlesByFolder = (fields = [], folder) =>
  getArticleSlugs(folder).map(slug => getArticleBySlug(slug, fields, folder));
```

If instead, a `containingFolder` is not passed to `getArticles()`, we then call the `allArticles()` function.

This function is similar, except we want to return every slug from every folder. So firstly we map over the return from `allContainingFolders()` (which we went over earlier).

```js
allContainingFolders().map(folder => {});
```

Within this map we run _another_ map, calling `getArticleSlugs()` on _each_ folder.

```js
allContainingFolders().map(folder => {
  getArticleSlugs(folder).map(slug => {});
});
```

We only want to call `getArticleBySlug()` on article slugs (and not on folders), so we then run a check that `slug` _is_ in fact an article, by checking that it has an `.md` extension.

```js
allContainingFolders().map(folder => {
  getArticleSlugs(folder).map(slug => {
    if (slug.slice(-3) === '.md') {
    }
  });
});
```

Finally, if `slug` is an article, we call `getArticleBySlug()`, passing-in `slug` and the containing `folder`.

The return is pushed to `articlesArray`, which we return from this function.

```js
const allArticles = (fields = []) => {
  let articlesArray = [];
  allContainingFolders().map(folder => {
    getArticleSlugs(folder).map(slug => {
      if (slug.slice(-3) === '.md') {
        articlesArray.push(getArticleBySlug(slug, fields, folder));
      }
    });
  });
  return articlesArray;
};
```

And with that, whether or not we passed-in a `containingFolder` to `getArticles()`, we now have an array of all the articles that we want to return, set to the variable `articles`.

```js
let articles = containingFolder ? articlesByFolder(fields, containingFolder) : allArticles(fields);
```

The last thing we do is sort the articles by the `published` date.

If you remember the YAML at the top of our Markdown files, we include the date that the article is `published` there. This is what we use to sort them, returning the most recently published first.

```js
articles.sort((article1, article2) => (article1.published > article2.published ? -1 : 1));
```

And with that, our API is done.

We can use this API by calling any of the three exported functions to return either the containing folders, a single article, or an array of articles.

The completed `api.rb` files is therefore:

```js
// lib/api.js

import fs from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';

const articlesPath = join(process.cwd(), '_articles');
const directoryPath = containingFolder =>
  `${articlesPath}${containingFolder ? `/${containingFolder}` : ''}`;

export const allContainingFolders = () =>
  ['', ...fs.readdirSync(articlesPath)].filter(file => file.slice(-3) !== '.md');

const getArticleSlugs = containingFolder => {
  return fs.readdirSync(directoryPath(containingFolder));
};

export const getArticleBySlug = (slug, fields = [], containingFolder = '') => {
  const realSlug = slug.replace(/\.md$/, '');
  const fullPath = join(directoryPath(containingFolder), `${realSlug}.md`);
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);

  const items = {};

  fields.forEach(field => {
    if (field === 'slug') {
      items[field] = realSlug;
    }
    if (field === 'section') {
      items[field] = containingFolder;
    }
    if (field === 'content') {
      items[field] = content;
    }
    if (field === 'minsToRead') {
      items[field] = Math.ceil(content.split(' ').length / 200);
    }

    if (typeof data[field] !== 'undefined') {
      items[field] = data[field];
    }
  });

  return items;
};

const allArticles = (fields = []) => {
  let articlesArray = [];
  allContainingFolders().map(folder => {
    getArticleSlugs(folder).map(slug => {
      if (slug.slice(-3) === '.md') {
        articlesArray.push(getArticleBySlug(slug, fields, folder));
      }
    });
  });
  return articlesArray;
};

const articlesByFolder = (fields = [], folder) =>
  getArticleSlugs(folder).map(slug => getArticleBySlug(slug, fields, folder));

export const getArticles = (fields = [], containingFolder = '') => {
  let articles = containingFolder
    ? articlesByFolder(fields, containingFolder)
    : allArticles(fields);

  return articles.sort((article1, article2) => (article1.published > article2.published ? -1 : 1));
};
```

## Updating the app

With the API done, we now need to make use of it in a way that the app automatically updates in every way we want it to, simply by adding a Markdown file. And this is where Next.js really comes into its own.

Ignoring the sitemap for now, based on the file tree that I added earlier, we need to call the API in four different places:

```
ðŸ“¦pages
 â”£ ðŸ“‚[section]
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ[slug].js
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.js
 â”£ ðŸ“‚my-story
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.js
 â”£ ðŸ“œindex.js
```

Let's start with the 'My story' page, because this is the simplest of the four.

### My story

Being a static page, we don't even need to fetch the paths from the API. We already know the slug that we want to use is `my-story`.

In order to have the article available for search engines to crawl, we're going to call the API in `getStaticProps`. Wanting just one article returned, we call `getArticleBySlug`, passing-in the `my-story` slug, and an array of the fields that we want returned.

```js
import { getArticleBySlug } from '../../lib/api';

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const article = getArticleBySlug('my-story', [
    'title',
    'description',
    'published',
    'content',
    'minsToRead',
    'coverImage',
  ]);
};
```

If you remember earlier, I said that the return `content` return from `gray-matter` "contains formatting." Well this is the point that we address that.

The `article` variable from the above code block, would be:

```js
{
  title: 'My Story',
  description: 'Why I code',
  published: '2022-04-19',
  content: '\n' +
    '## The pre-coding years\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Throughout my teenage years, I'd been very into video games, so it seemed logical that when it came to choosing my subjects for sixth-form college, that computing was one of them.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "On the first day of this A-level computing course, aged 16, I sat in the classroom, listening to the teacher drone on in his monotone voice about topics that I didn't understand. I looked around the class, and saw myself surrounded by peers that I couldn't relate to.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'I felt very out of place.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "I had some friends who'd taken economics and business studies, and they were raving about how fun the content had been of their first class, and how charismatic their teacher was. They had genuinely enjoyed it.\n" +
    '\n' + ...,
  minsToRead: 87,
  coverImage: '/images/my-story/litang.jpeg',
```

I won't paste all of `content`, but you get the idea. It's not very nice to look at. It's Markdown as we write it, but even worse.

`'\n'` instead of line-breaks, `+` signs everywhere. Probably not how we want our final article to be formatted.

If you look back to the file tree again, you'll see a `markdownToHtml.js` file that we haven't mentioned yet.

`markdownToHtml` returns the `markdownToHtml` function, and here is where we call that.

```js
import { getArticleBySlug } from '../../lib/api';
import markdownToHtml from '../../lib/markdownToHtml';

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const article = getArticleBySlug('my-story', [
    'title',
    'description',
    'published',
    'content',
    'minsToRead',
    'coverImage',
  ]);
};
const content = await markdownToHtml(article.content || '');
```

The full `markdownToHtml.js` file is as follows:

```js
import { remark } from 'remark';
import html from 'remark-html';

const markdownToHtml = async markdown => {
  const result = await remark().use(html).process(markdown);
  return result.toString();
};

export default markdownToHtml;
```

`remark` is a tool that parses and compiles Markdown. `remark-html` is a plugin for `remark`, that converts Markdown to html.

So we call `remark()`, tell it to `use()` the `html` plugin, and then pass the Markdown that we want converted, in this case our article, to `process`.

This returns a [vfile](https://github.com/vfile/vfile). We can call `.toString()` on this vfile, and return our article as html.

Going back to our `getStaticProps` function, we now just need to return the article as `props`, overwriting the `content` key with the parsed article.

We also pass-in the article subtitle (this is used when determining the content of the `<title>` tag in the page header, so is consistent across all pages within a section, hence why we set it here, rather than in the YAML at the top of each Markdown file).

```js
export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const article = getArticleBySlug('my-story', [
    'title',
    'description',
    'published',
    'content',
    'minsToRead',
    'coverImage',
  ]);
  const content = await markdownToHtml(article.content || '');

  return {
    props: {
      article: {
        ...article,
        content,
        subtitle: 'Why I became a software engineer',
      },
    },
  };
};
```

There is an `<ArticleContainer>` component that handles displaying our articles, so we pass the article as a prop to that component, and with that we have our article, fetched from the API, and visible to search engine crawlers.

The entire file is as follows:

```js
// pages/my-story/index.js

import { getArticleBySlug } from '../../lib/api';
import markdownToHtml from '../../lib/markdownToHtml';
import ArticleContainer from '../../components/layout/main-content/article-container';

const MyStory = ({ article }) => {
  return <ArticleContainer article={article} />;
};

export default MyStory;

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const article = getArticleBySlug('my-story', [
    'title',
    'description',
    'published',
    'content',
    'minsToRead',
    'coverImage',
  ]);
  const content = await markdownToHtml(article.content || '');

  return {
    props: {
      article: {
        ...article,
        content,
        subtitle: 'Why I became a software engineer',
      },
    },
  };
};
```

I'm not going to go over the `<ArticleContainer>` component itself, or any child component in any detail, because it's pretty simple.

But just briefly, it renders an `<ArticleHeader>` (for example, the top of this page) and an `<ArticleBody>` (what you're looking at right now).

The `<ArticleBody>` component, which is where the article `content` is displayed, is as follows:

```js
// components/layout/main-content/article-container/ArticleBody.js

const ArticleBody = props => {
  return (
    <section className='-mt-32 max-w-7xl mx-auto relative z-10 md:pb-6 sm:px-6 lg:px-8'>
      <div className='flex justify-center py-4 px-4 lg:py-8 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 bg-white rounded-lg shadow'>
        <div
          className='prose max-w-full 2xl:max-w-[900px] prose-img:m-0 prose-img:rounded-md prose-img:shadow-lg prose-pre:max-w-full'
          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: props.content }}
        />
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};

export default ArticleBody;
```

If the class names all look a bit funny, then you haven't tried Tailwind yet, and you're missing-out.

However, the important part of this component is `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: props.content }}`. This renders the value of `props.content` (our article) within the containing `<div>` tag.

`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is named as such, because if you're allowing other people to enter data that is rendered by `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, you're leaving users vulnerable to [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attacks.

However, as the only HTML being rendered here comes from the Markdown articles that I wrote, it's perfectly safe.

And with that, in our most simple of cases of displaying the 'My story' article, we are done.

### [slug].js

Next let's look at `[slug].js`. This does exactly the same thing as `my-story`, with the exception that the page name is dynamic.

And what that means, is that in addition to `getStaticProps`, we also have to run the `getStaticPaths` function, in order to establish these page names.

It's worth at this point, establishing _how_ the various sections of the app are populated.

When you look at the sidebar (or the Navbar menu if you're on mobile), and you see `Home`, `Projects`, `Templates` etc., how did they get there?

I like to keep related data in one place, so I have a `useSectionDetails` hook that contains all of these section details:

```js
// hooks/useSectionDetails.js

import {
  ChatIcon,
  HomeIcon,
  PaperClipIcon,
  TemplateIcon,
  TrendingUpIcon,
} from '@heroicons/react/outline';

const contact = 'contact';
const home = 'home';
const myStory = 'my-story';
const projects = 'projects';
const templates = 'templates';

export const sectionOrder = [home, projects, templates, myStory, contact];
export const articleSections = [projects, templates];

const useSectionDetails = () => {
  const sectionDetails = sectionName => {
    switch (sectionName) {
      case contact:
        return {
          title: 'Contact',
          linkText: 'Contact',
          route: `/${contact}`,
          icon: ChatIcon,
        };
      case home:
        return {
          title: 'jethro.codes',
          description: 'My home for everything code',
          linkText: 'Home',
          route: '/',
          icon: HomeIcon,
        };
      case myStory:
        return {
          title: 'My Story',
          linkText: 'My Story',
          route: `/${myStory}`,
          icon: TrendingUpIcon,
        };
      case projects:
        return {
          title: 'Projects',
          description: 'Going in depth on my latest personal projects',
          linkText: 'Projects',
          route: `/${projects}`,
          icon: PaperClipIcon,
        };
      case templates:
        return {
          title: 'Templates',
          description: 'Project templates to save time starting from scratch',
          linkText: 'Templates',
          route: `/${templates}`,
          icon: TemplateIcon,
        };
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unrecognised section name '${sectionName}' passed to useSectionDetails`);
    }
  };

  return sectionDetails;
};

export default useSectionDetails;
```

I won't go over every case of how this data is used, because most of it is irrelevant to the articles, and that's what I want to focus on here. However, there is one important line:

```js
export const articleSections = [projects, templates];
```

This `articleSections` variable sets _which_ sections of our app contain articles.

At the time of writing, that's just `projects` and `templates`, but in the future (if I find the time), may include `blog`, `packages`, `gems`, `tutorials` etc.

Going back to our `getStaticPaths` function in `[slug].js`, we import `articleSections` to know _where_ we need to look for articles.

```js
import { getArticles } from '../../lib/api';
import { articleSections } from '../../hooks/useSectionDetails';

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
  const articles = [];

  articleSections.map(section => {
    articles.push(getArticles(['slug', 'section'], section));
  });
};
```

If you remember the `getArticles` function from earlier, it returns _all_ the articles for a given section.

However, as we're mapping over _all_ sections, the `articles` array will contain _all_ articles (with the exception of 'my-story', as that's not contained within a section).

At this stage, as we're only establishing the `paths` of these articles, we're only interested in returning the `slug` and the `section`.

So with all articles now set to `articles`, we can loop over them, and set the `section` and the `slug`.

```
ðŸ“¦pages
 â”£ ðŸ“‚[section]
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ[slug].js
```

So our full `getStaticPaths` function becomes:

```js
import { getArticles } from '../../lib/api';
import { articleSections } from '../../hooks/useSectionDetails';

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
  const articles = [];

  articleSections.map(section => {
    articles.push(getArticles(['slug', 'section'], section));
  });

  return {
    paths: articles.flat().map(article => {
      return {
        params: {
          section: article.section,
          slug: article.slug,
        },
      };
    }),
    fallback: 'blocking',
  };
};
```

The rest of the `[slug].js` file is fairly similar to the 'My story' section, as now having each of the article paths, we just need to fetch each article from the API.

`getStaticProps` will run for every article, passing-in the `params` that we returned above.

```js
return {
  params: {
    section: article.section,
    slug: article.slug,
  },
};
```

So when we call `getStaticProps`, we already have the `slug` and the `section`. We can therefore call `getArticleBySlug()`, and subsequently `markdownToHtml()` exactly as we did in the 'My story' section:

```js
import { getArticleBySlug } from '../../lib/api';
import markdownToHtml from '../../lib/markdownToHtml';

export const getStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const article = getArticleBySlug(
    params.slug,
    ['title', 'description', 'published', 'content', 'coverImage', 'tags', 'minsToRead'],
    params.section
  );
};
```

The only slight additions, is that the `subtitle` will change, depending on the section, so we have a simple function for that, where we pass-in `params.section` as the argument.

```js
const subtitle = section => {
  switch (section) {
    case 'projects':
      return 'Anatomy of a Project';
    case 'templates':
      return 'Project Template';
    default:
      return '';
  }
};
```

And we also need to determing the `type`.

If you go to the very top of this page, you'll see `PROJECT` in blue letters, right above the title.

That's the `type`, as in the `type` of article. And for all current sections, and future sections that I've so far conceived, simply removing the last 's' from the section name determines the type (so `projects` becomes `PROJECT`, `templates` becomes `TEMPLATE` etc.).

For as long as that remains true, then `params.section.slice(0, -1)` will suffice.

Every other part of the `[slug].js` file was covered in the 'My story' section, so I hope that it's clear.

The full `[slug].js` file is therefore:

```js
// pages/[section]/[slug].js

import { getArticleBySlug, getArticles } from '../../lib/api';
import markdownToHtml from '../../lib/markdownToHtml';

import ArticleContainer from '../../components/layout/main-content/article-container';

import { articleSections } from '../../hooks/useSectionDetails';

const Article = ({ article }) => {
  return <ArticleContainer article={article} />;
};

export default Article;

export const getStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const article = getArticleBySlug(
    params.slug,
    ['title', 'description', 'published', 'content', 'coverImage', 'tags', 'minsToRead'],
    params.section
  );
  const content = await markdownToHtml(article.content || '');

  const subtitle = section => {
    switch (section) {
      case 'projects':
        return 'Anatomy of a Project';
      case 'templates':
        return 'Project Template';
      default:
        return '';
    }
  };

  return {
    props: {
      article: {
        ...article,
        content,
        type: params.section.slice(0, -1),
        subtitle: subtitle(params.section),
      },
    },
  };
};

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
  const articles = [];

  articleSections.map(section => {
    articles.push(getArticles(['slug', 'section'], section));
  });

  return {
    paths: articles.flat().map(article => {
      return {
        params: {
          section: article.section,
          slug: article.slug,
        },
      };
    }),
    fallback: 'blocking',
  };
};
```

### [section]/index.js

So far what we've been able to achieve, is dynamically fetching and displaying the articles, simply by adding a Markdown file.

`getStaticPaths` in `[slug].js` will check for any articles that exist at build time.

However, at this stage although the articles will be hosted within the app, no one will have any way of finding them or knowing that they're there, because so far we haven't updated the homepage or the section page. So let's take care of that next.

```
ðŸ“¦pages
 â”£ ðŸ“‚[section]
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ[slug].js
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.js
 â”£ ðŸ“‚my-story
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.js
 â”£ ðŸ“œindex.js
```

Like `[slug].js`, `[section]/index.js` is a dynamic file where we have to tell it its name by using `getStaticPaths`.

Luckily, we already know the various sections of our app, because they're contained within the `articleSections` variable or our `useSectionDetails` hook. So just like in `[slug].js`, we import that variable.

```js
import { articleSections } from '../../hooks/useSectionDetails';
```

Within `getStaticPaths` we again map over this array, although this time we don't care about fetching any slugs, we simply want to tell `[section]/index.js` which paths to create.

Assuming that `articleSections` returns `['projects', 'templates']`, then we want a `projects` page and a `templates` page, so our `getStaticPaths` function becomes:

```js
import { articleSections } from '../../hooks/useSectionDetails';

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
  return {
    paths: articleSections.map(section => {
      return {
        params: {
          section: section,
        },
      };
    }),
    fallback: 'blocking',
  };
};
```

On these 'section' pages, we have no interest in displaying the entire article, we simply want enough information to populate the "cards" on each page, and link to the article itself.

To that end, we need five pieces of information about each article; the `title`, `description`, `slug`, `coverImage` and `section`.

So in our `getStaticProps` function, we call our API `getArticles` function, pass-in the section (`projects` or `templates`) for whichever page we're on, as well as the required fields, and set the returned array to the `allArticles` variable. We then return `allArticles` as our props.

```js
import { getArticles } from '../../lib/api';
import { articleSections } from '../../hooks/useSectionDetails';

export const getStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const allArticles = getArticles(
    ['title', 'description', 'slug', 'coverImage', 'section'],
    params.section
  );

  return {
    props: { allArticles },
  };
};

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
  return {
    paths: articleSections.map(section => {
      return {
        params: {
          section: section,
        },
      };
    }),
    fallback: 'blocking',
  };
};
```

From here, we have three main components that make-up this page; the `<SectionHome>` component, a `<HorizontalCardsContainer>` and a `<HorizontalCard>`.

```js
// pages/[section]/index.js

import { getArticles } from '../../lib/api';
import HorizontalCard from '../../components/ui/HorizontalCard';
import HorizontalCardsContainer from '../../components/ui/HorizontalCardsContainer';
import SectionHome from '../../components/layout/main-content/section-home';
import { articleSections } from '../../hooks/useSectionDetails';
import useHeroImage from '../../hooks/useHeroImage';

const Section = ({ allArticles }) => {
  return (
    <SectionHome heroImage={useHeroImage(allArticles)}>
      <HorizontalCardsContainer>
        {allArticles.map(article => (
          <HorizontalCard key={`${article.title}-card`} cardDetails={article} />
        ))}
      </HorizontalCardsContainer>
    </SectionHome>
  );
};

export default Section;

export const getStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const allArticles = getArticles(
    ['title', 'description', 'slug', 'coverImage', 'section'],
    params.section
  );

  return {
    props: { allArticles },
  };
};

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
  return {
    paths: articleSections.map(section => {
      return {
        params: {
          section: section,
        },
      };
    }),
    fallback: 'blocking',
  };
};
```

As with other sections, I don't intend to go over the styling of these three components, as there's nothing very complex in there.

For simplicity, I've also omitted part of the `[section]/index.js` (mainly related to adding the `<Head>`).

The full file can be found [HERE] - ADD LINK ONCE MOVED FILE IS ON MASTER

And with that, at build time our `[section]/index.js` page will create a page for _each_ section stored within our `articleSections` variable, and will fetch all of the articles for that section, creating a card for each article.

That means that, just by adding a Markdown article within the correct sub-folder of our `_articles` folder, the article will be automatically fetched made available to our readers.

```
ðŸ“¦_articles
 â”£ ðŸ“‚projects
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œjethro-codes.md
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmeals-of-change.md
 â”£ ðŸ“‚templates
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œrails-api.md
 â”— ðŸ“œmy-story.md
```

### Homepage

The last place that we want to display our new article, is the homepage, as if you were to take a look at the homepage now, you'll see that it displays the six most recently published articles.

At this point, we've done all the hard work and updating the homepage is comparatively simple.
