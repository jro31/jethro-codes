## Background

At the time I started this project, I'd been coding for around three years. I'd worked almost solely as a Rails dev during that time, only ever using React very reluctantly.

During those jobs, I'd never been given any time to learn React, and in the first, it was React, pre-hooks, with Redux, pre Redux Toolkit. With zero React learning behind me, I couldn't make head nor tail of what most of the code meant. I got by, by looking at and trying to replicate the existing code, but not really understanding what was going on.

I had a similar experience in my next job where, despite being hired as a backend Rails dev, I was again put onto React projects despite my insistance that we had devs in the team better-suited to the task, and again I was able to scrape by, just by trying to replicate, even while not understanding the existing code.

These experiences gave me a real aversion to React, as I was just thrown into these occasional React projects, often with tight deadlines, with zero time to actually learn the basics.

All of that being said, when I came to the end of my time in the latter of these jobs, I was acutely aware that while very talented as a Rails dev, the gaping hole in my skillset was the lack of a front-end library.

On my personal projects up to this time, I'd got by with jQuery, and even vanilla Javascript. But if I really wanted to consider myself a fullstack dev, and to be able to build modern projects from start to deployment, I needed the knowledge of a front-end library. So on leaving this job, and even slightly before, I focussed all of my energy on learning React.

And you know what? When you're actually given the time learn it properly, and not just thrown into projects with zero knowledge and given tight deadlines, React is really a joy to work with.

I try to be as receptive as I can to all sources of knowledge, although there's no doubting that my primary resource for learning React was Academind's excellent course, [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

I spent about a month working through this course as if my full-time job. But as with any skill, it's only useful and only sharpened so much as you put it into practice. I wanted a project that could would utilise everything that I'd learned, and put it into practice.

That's where Meals of Change comes in.

I've always been a fan of recipes apps as a means of learning, because they ask for such a wide range of skills; forms, photo uploads, complex styling etc. And this project could almost be considered version 3.

When I'd finished the Rails bootcamp that largely introduced me to coding, the first project I made, starting the day after graduation while still drunk from the night before, was another recipes app called 'Plant as Usual'.

It was an app for plant-based recipes, and the rationale for the name was how people think of plant-based meals as very bland. 'Plant as Usual' was an ironic play on the phrase 'bland as usual', where it would try to show that plant-based recipes didn't have to be bland.

It was also that the domain only cost £6 per year. Had I been able to afford it, I'd have gone for something much more generic.

That app, Plant as Usual version 1, was the first app that I built and hosted from scratch, and it led to me getting my first coding job. But alas, a year or so later, now with some experience under my belt, I looked back at this app with a bit of shame for how bad the code now looked to me.

That spawned Plant as Usual version 2; a much improved, from the ground up rebuild of Plant as Usual version 1.

But for however improved the Rails code within it was, the front-end was built with jQuery.

As at this point, never having the time to grasp the basic workings of React, I found jQuery far easier to work with, despite the way that people spoke about it online as some archaic language.

_"Hey... it works for me"_, I thought to myself.

But now I finally had an understanding of the basics of React, I too looked at jQuery with a bit of disdain.

_"Oh, I get it now."_

And so was spawned, Plant as Usual version 3, although going through a rebrand, again which was driven by the .com domains that were available for £6/year, Meals of Change was born.
